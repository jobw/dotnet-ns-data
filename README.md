# NsDataTest

A simple program that allows insight into and manipulation of the timetable of the Dutch national railways (NS). Code can be reused in different applications! Written as a fun side project. 

To use the application:
1. Create a folder named "Dataset" in the same location as the Journey.cs file.
2. Go to https://reisinformatiegroep.nl/ndovloket/ and create an account.
3. Download the following Dataset: https://reisinformatiegroep.nl/ndovloket/Data/ShowDataCollection/2.\ Extract the files into the Dataset folder.\
   The program has been tested with dataset: NDOV_15_16_17_18.zip, version: 0171 (Direct download link: https://reisinformatiegroep.nl/ndovloket/Data/DownloadDataFile/430132 ). \
   Older or newer versions should work fine, though some older versions may require new files to be added manually.
5. If the program gives an error saying it requires a file named "error.tmp", simply create a new, empty, file with that name in the Dataset folder.
