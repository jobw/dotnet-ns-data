# NsDataTest

A simple program that allows insight into and manipulation of the timetable of the Dutch national railways (NS). Code can be reused in different applications! Written as a fun side project. 

To use the application:
1. Create a folder named "Dataset" in the same location as the Journey.cs file.
2. Go to https://reisinformatiegroep.nl/ndovloket/ and create an account.
3. Download the following Dataset: https://reisinformatiegroep.nl/ndovloket/Data/ShowDataCollection/2. Extract the files into the Dataset folder.
4. If the program gives an error saying it requires a file named "error.tmp", simply create a new, empty, file with that name in the Dataset folder.
